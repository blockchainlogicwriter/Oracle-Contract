# Oracle-Contract
This is a basic Oracle contract written in Solidity. An Oracle contract serves as a bridge between smart contracts on the blockchain and external data sources, allowing smart contracts to access off-chain data reliably.

Contract Features
Data Request and Response Events

The contract emits DataRequest and DataResponse events to notify when data is requested and responded to.
Request Data

Users can call the requestData function to request data from external sources by providing the data source and query.
A unique request ID is generated using the keccak256 hash function, incorporating the timestamp, caller's address, data source, and query.
Respond to Request

Only the contract owner can call the respondToRequest function to provide the requested data.
The provided result is stored in the contract's data mapping with the corresponding request ID.
Get Data

Users can retrieve the requested data by calling the getData function with the request ID.
Usage
Request Data

Call the requestData function with the data source and query to request data.
Example: requestData("API_URL", "BTC/USD price")
Respond to Request

Only the contract owner can call the respondToRequest function with the request ID and the result.
Example: respondToRequest(requestId, 50000)
Get Data

Call the getData function with the request ID to retrieve the requested data.
Example: getData(requestId)
Security Considerations
Ensure that the Oracle contract owner is trusted and responsible for providing accurate data.
Validate and sanitize data received from external sources to prevent manipulation or exploitation.
Consider implementing access control mechanisms and security audits to protect against unauthorized access or data tampering.
